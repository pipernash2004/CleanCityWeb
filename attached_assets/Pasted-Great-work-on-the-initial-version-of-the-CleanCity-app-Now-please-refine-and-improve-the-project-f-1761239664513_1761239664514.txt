Great work on the initial version of the CleanCity app! Now, please refine and improve the project for better structure, performance, and presentation. 

Here’s what I’d like you to do:

---

🏗️ **1. Codebase Organization**
- Refactor code for **clean modularity** — separate routes, controllers, and models more clearly. 
- Keep **high cohesion and low coupling** in each module.
- Ensure consistent naming conventions across the backend (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components).

---

⚙️ **2. Backend Optimization**
- Improve API performance with efficient Mongoose queries.
- Add input validation (using a lightweight library like express-validator or a simple custom middleware).
- Add comments summarizing architecture trade-offs (performance over strict security, modular monolith, etc.).
- Make sure API routes follow RESTful conventions:
  - `POST /api/reports` → create report
  - `GET /api/reports` → get all reports
  - `PUT /api/reports/:id` → update report
  - `DELETE /api/reports/:id` → delete report
- Handle errors gracefully with centralized error middleware.

🎨 **3. Frontend Improvements**
- Polish the **UI with TailwindCSS** — clean layout, soft colors, responsive for mobile.
- Create a **simple dashboard layout**:
  - Navbar with logo + logout button.
  - Sidebar or tabs for “My Reports” and “Admin Dashboard.”
- Use React Router for navigation between pages.
- Display reports in cards or a table with status badges (e.g., Pending, In Progress, Resolved).

---

🔗 **4. Frontend–Backend Integration**
- Use **Axios** for API communication.
- Make sure JWT authentication is properly handled (token saved in localStorage and added to headers).
- Test data flow end-to-end (report creation → backend storage → frontend display).

---

🧠 **5. Documentation and Architecture Explanation**
- Update the **README.md** with:
  - Overview of the system’s purpose.
  - Installation and run instructions for Replit.
  - Short explanation of your architectural decisions and trade-offs.
- Add comments in code describing why this architecture was chosen (performance + maintainability focus).

---

💡 **6. Stretch Goals (Optional, if time allows)**
- Add filtering (e.g., view reports by category or status).
- Add pagination or lazy loading for reports.
- Add basic analytics on the admin dashboard (e.g., number of reports resolved).
- Include a simple `.env` example for environment variables.

---

🎯 **Goal**
Make this version clean, fast, and presentable enough to show in a portfolio or on my CV as a “Software Architecture Project.” 

Ensure it demonstrates:
✅ Professional code structure  
✅ Performance-focused architecture  
✅ Maintainability and clarity  
✅ Visual polish and usability  

When done, summarize what architectural and code improvements you made.
