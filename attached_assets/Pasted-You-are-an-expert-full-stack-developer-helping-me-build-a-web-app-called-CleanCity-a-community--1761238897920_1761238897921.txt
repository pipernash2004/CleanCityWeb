You are an expert full-stack developer helping me build a web app called **CleanCity**, a community and environment issue-reporting platform. I’m a Computer Science student at the University of Zimbabwe training to become a software architect. I want to design this project with strong architectural principles for performance, modularity, and maintainability.

🏗️ **Project Goal**
Build a meaningful, real-world MVP web application where users can report local community issues (like waste dumping, water leaks, and road problems), and admins can view and update their status.

This app will be added to my CV, so make the structure professional, easy to extend, and clearly architected.

🧠 **Architectural Intent & Trade-offs**
- Prioritize **performance** and **maintainability**.
- **Basic authentication only** (no payments or sensitive data).
- Use **high cohesion** and **low coupling** for easy maintenance.
- Design a **modular monolith** (simple now, scalable later).
- Separate backend modules: `AuthModule`, `ReportModule`, and `AdminModule`.
- Keep folder structure and file naming consistent and clean.
- Provide clear **code comments** explaining key architectural decisions.

⚙️ **Technical Stack**
- **Frontend:** React + TailwindCSS (responsive and mobile-friendly)
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express
- **Database:** MongoDB (using Mongoose ODM)
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Token)
- **Image Storage:** Optional Cloudinary integration
- **Environment:** Replit (should run end-to-end inside Replit)

🧩 **Core Features**
1. **User Registration & Login**
   - Basic signup and login using JWT.
2. **Submit a Report**
   - Fields: title, description, category (waste, water, road), location (text), optional image.
3. **Admin Dashboard**
   - View all reports and mark them as *pending*, *in progress*, or *resolved*.
4. **Public Feed**
   - Display a simple list or map of community reports and their status.
5. **Responsive UI**
   - Use TailwindCSS for a clean, modern design.
